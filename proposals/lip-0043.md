## Abstract

This LIP introduces the concept of chain registration in the Lisk ecosystem. The chain registration is a necessary step to make a sidechain interoperable with the Lisk mainchain. Specifically, for the Lisk mainchain, this LIP specifies a new command for the sidechain registration. This command creates a sidechain account in the Lisk mainchain with some specific properties given by the user submitting the transaction. Similarly for sidechains, this LIP specifies the mainchain registration command.

## Motivation

The Lisk ecosystem is a permissionless network of blockchains where a sidechain following the standard protocol can interoperate with any other Lisk compatible chain. In particular, the Lisk mainchain serves as a central node or relayer for the entire ecosystem and every cross-chain interaction has to be sent through it. This implies there should exist a standardized protocol for the Lisk mainchain to maintain a _cross-chain channel_ to communicate with every sidechain.

The first step for establishing this _cross-chain channel_ protocol is the chain registration process, which can be thought of as the creation/opening of the channel between two chains. This process defines the data structures, and protocol rules that every chain needs to implement in the ecosystem if they want to interoperate with another specific chain.

For a general picture of the Lisk interoperability architecture, please refer to [Introduce Interoperability module LIP][research:interop-module].

## Rationale

In this LIP, the registration process introduced in the previous section is specified from the point of view of both the Lisk mainchain and sidechains. For the Lisk mainchain, this is done by the sidechain registration command, whereas for sidechains, it is done by the mainchain registration command.

### Sidechain Registration Process

As mentioned above, for a sidechain to be interoperable in the Lisk ecosystem, it has to be registered in the Lisk Mainchain via a sidechain registration command. A transaction with this command can be sent by any user account in the Lisk Mainchain with enough funds to pay the required fee. The processing of this command implies the creation of a _sidechain account_ in the mainchain state associated with a unique network identifier and a name. This means that every new sidechain occupies a certain namespace in the ecosystem. Additionally, every newly registered sidechain can increase the size of every cross-chain update command posted on the mainchain (due to the increasing size of the [`outboxRootWitness`][research:ccu#outbox-root-witness] property of the command). For these two reasons, the minimum fee for this command has an added constant similar to the extra fee in a [delegate registration command][docs:delegate]. The value of this extra registration fee is 10 LSK.

Once the sidechain registration command is processed, the sidechain account status is set to _registered_. In this state, the cross-chain channel is still not active, so the users on the mainchain or other chains cannot send [cross-chain messages (CCMs)][ccmLIP] to this sidechain yet. Moreover, the [liveness requirement][liveness] to maintain the channel is not enforced, this means that there is no specific time requirement for a sidechain to be activated on the mainchain, it can stay in the registered status for any period of time.  When a valid cross-chain update command from this sidechain containing a valid [registration CCM][registrationCCMRationale] is processed, the sidechain status is changed to _active,_ making it active in the ecosystem. Now it is possible to send CCMs to the sidechain and the liveness condition is enforced.

#### Sidechain Structures on Mainchain

As mentioned above, when a new sidechain is registered on the mainchain via a registration command, a sidechain account is created in the Lisk mainchain state.  Specifically, this implies that the corresponding key-value entries for the sidechain are added to the interoperability module store (see Figure 1). The values of these entries are initialized as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP, concretely the `name`, `networkID`, and `initValidators` properties are computed from the sidechain registration command.

This sidechain registration command also assigns a unique integer as the chain ID to the newly registered sidechain. This chain ID integer is also part of the key of the interoperability store entries for the registered sidechain as shown in Figure 1.

![interoperability_store](lip-0043/chain_interoperability_store.png)

_Figure 1: Example of the interoperability store. For Lisk mainchain, the ‘own chain’ entry exists by default in the mainchain state whereas there is one entry per registered sidechain for the other four stores created by a sidechain registration command. For sidechains, the ‘own chain’ and mainchain account entries are unique in the state tree and are created by a mainchain registration command._

#### Sidechain Registration Command

The sidechain registration command contains the following parameters used to connect a new sidechain in the ecosystem.

##### name

The `name` property sets the name of the sidechain as a string of characters. It has to be unique in the ecosystem.

##### genesisBlockId

The ID of the genesis block (as defined in [LIP 0034][lip-0034]). It is computed from the SHA-256 digest of the serialized bytes of the sidechain genesis block. It can also help future sidechain node operators to identify the sidechain genesis block with respect to its value.

##### initValidators

This property defines the set of eligible [BLS public keys][BLSkeys] with their respective [BFT weights][BFTweights] required to sign the first certificate from the sidechain.

##### certificateThreshold

The `certificateThreshold` property is an integer setting the required cumulative weight needed for a certificate signature from the sidechain to be valid.

#### Chain ID

The chain ID uniquely identifies a chain in the Lisk ecosystem. It serves a similar purpose for chains as [docs:address][docs:address] do for user accounts. The chain ID for a sidechain is deterministically computed when processing the sidechain registration command. Specifically, the chain ID of a new sidechain is assigned as an incremental integer similar to [transaction nonces][docs:nonces]. For example, if there are 41 chains already registered in the Lisk ecosystem (the mainchain and 40 sidechains), the next registered sidechain will have `chainID = 42`. The chain ID has to be stated in every cross-chain interaction. For example, it has to be specified in the `receivingChainID` property of a CCM to this sidechain and in the `sendingChainId` property of a cross-chain update command from this sidechain.

The format of chain IDs aims to provide an efficient and compact way to uniquely identify chains in the ecosystem. This has another advantage in terms of usability: Users can easily remember the integer assigned as chain ID for their favorite blockchain applications.

#### Sidechain Network Identifier

The network identifier, or network ID, is a byte sequence unique to a chain that has to be prepended to the input of the signing function of every transaction, block, or message of the chain. It is necessary to avoid transaction replays between different chains in the ecosystem.

In the Lisk ecosystem, the network ID for a sidechain is computed as the hash digest of the sidechain genesis block ID given in a transaction with the registration command and the address of the account sending this transaction. This is convenient for two reasons:

1. The sidechain developers can pre-compute the network ID of their sidechain as soon as they set the genesis block and an account to send the transaction on the mainchain. The sidechain can be started already from this moment without being registered on the mainchain.
2. The network ID is known to the mainchain as soon as the sidechain is registered, thus it can validate cross-chain update commands coming from the sidechain without further context.

This LIP overwrites the network ID definition given in [LIP 0009][lip-0009] and solves the open problem given in the Rationale section of that LIP. Note that in the case of a sidechain undergoing a community hard fork, one of the competing forks will need to register their fork of the sidechain again on the Lisk Mainchain. Regardless of the genesis block ID set by this sidechain fork, it has to be registered from a different user account which implies that the chain ID and network ID of the forked chain will be different from the original one.

### Mainchain Registration on a Sidechain

Once the sidechain has been registered on the mainchain, a similar registration process should happen in the sidechain before the interoperable channel is opened between the two chains. This is done by submitting a transaction with the mainchain registration command in the sidechain, which implies the creation of a _mainchain account_ in the sidechain state associated with the Lisk mainchain and other structures needed for interoperability. This mainchain account has a similar structure as the one depicted in Figure 1. By protocol, the chain ID of the mainchain is a constant equal to 1 in the ecosystem. The network ID of the mainchain is also a constant since it has to be known to validate cross-chain update commands.

This registration process has to happen always after the sidechain registration on the mainchain since the sidechain has no prior knowledge of the current mainchain validators or its own chain ID and name. Similar to the sidechain registration case, the _mainchain account_ status will not change to active until a valid cross-chain update command from the mainchain containing a valid [registration CCM][registrationCCMRationale] is processed.

#### Mainchain Registration Command

The mainchain registration command sets certain parameters in the sidechain related to the interoperability module and initializes the corresponding mainchain account. This command requires the approval of the sidechain validators. They have to agree on the content of this command and add their aggregated signatures accordingly. It is important that the sidechain validators make sure that they are signing the registration command with the right information from the mainchain, otherwise, the sidechain interoperable functionality may be unusable.

This command has no requirement for a minimum fee since it should be submitted only once in a sidechain and approved by a majority of validators. For this reason, a transaction with this command should be treated differently in terms of priority in case it is included in a sidechain node’s transaction pool. The recommendation is that, once the transaction is properly signed by the validators and ready to be submitted, a validator simply includes it in its next forged block without including it in the transaction pool. The command has the following parameters.

##### mainchainValidators

Similar to the `initValidators` property in the sidechain registration command, it defines the set of mainchain validators with their respective BFT weight expected to sign the first certificate from the mainchain.

##### ownChainID

The chain ID assigned to this sidechain on the mainchain after processing the corresponding sidechain registration command.

##### ownName

The `ownName` property sets the name of the sidechain in its own state according to the name given in the mainchain.

        }
    }
}
```

#### Verification

Let `trs` be a transaction with module ID `MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY` and command ID `COMMAND_ID_SIDECHAIN_REG` to be verified. Then the set of validity rules to validate `trs.params` are:

* The `trs.params.name` property has to contain only characters from the set `[a-z0-9!@$&_.]` and has to be at most `MAX_LENGTH_NAME` characters long.
* The `trs.params.name `property has to be unique with respect to the set of already registered sidechain names in the blockchain state, such that the entry with store prefix equal to `STORE_PREFIX_REGISTERED_NAMES` and store key equal to `trs.params.name` (serialized as a utf-8 encoded string) does not exist in the store.
* Let `netId` be the hash digest of `SHA-256(trs.params.genesisBlockId || senderAddress)` where `||` indicates bytes concatenation and `senderAddress` is the address of the user account corresponding to the `trs.senderPublicKey` property:
  * Then `netId` has to be unique with respect to the set of already registered sidechain network IDs in the blockchain state.
That is the entry with store prefix equal to `STORE_PREFIX_NETWORK_ID` and store key equal to `trs.params.netID` does not exist in the store.
* Rules for `trs.params.initValidators` array:
  * The array must have at least 1 element and at most `MAX_NUM_VALIDATORS` elements.
  * The array must be ordered lexicographically by `blsKey` property.
  * The `blsKey` property of each element has a length of 48 bytes.
  * The `blsKey` property of each element is unique within the array.
  * The `bftWeight` property of each element is a positive integer.
  * Let `totalWeight` be the sum of the `bftWeight` property of every element in the `trs.params.initValidators` array. Then `totalWeight` has to be less than or equal to `MAX_UINT64`.
* The range of valid values of the `trs.params.certificateThreshold` property is given by the total sum of the validators weights:
  * Minimum value: `floor(1/3 * totalWeight) + 1`.
  * Maximum value: `totalWeight`.

#### Execution

When a sidechain registration command is executed, new entries for the Interoperability module are created in the mainchain state (see Figure 1). In particular, let `trs` be a transaction with module ID `MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY` and command ID `COMMAND_ID_SIDECHAIN_REG` to be executed. Then:

* The chain ID of the sidechain is assigned as  `chainID = numberOfChains + 1`, where `numberOfChains` is the total number of registered chains on the Lisk mainchain (counting Lisk Mainchain).
* An entry in the chain data substore as specified in [Introduce Interoperability module LIP][interopAccount] is created as:
  * `storePrefix`: `STORE_PREFIX_CHAIN_DATA`
  * `storeKey`: `uint32be(chainID)`.
  * `storeValue`: `sidechainAccount` where `sidechainAccount` is the chain account object, serialized according to the `chainAccountSchema` schema defined in Introduce Interoperability module LIP, and initialized as:
    * The `sidechainAccount.name` property is equal to the `trs.params.name` property.
    * The `sidechainAccount.networkID` property is calculated as the output of `SHA-256(trs.params.genesisBlockId || senderAddress)` where `||` indicates bytes concatenation and `senderAddress` is the address of the user account corresponding to the `trs.senderPublicKey` property.
    * The `sidechainAccount.activeValidators` property is equal to the `trs.params.initValidators` property.
    * The `sidechainAccount.certificateThreshold` property is equal to the `trs.params.certificateThreshold` property.
    * The following [registration CCM][regCCM] is added to `sidechainAccount.outbox` by calling the `addToOutbox(chainID, registrationCCM)` logic as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP:

    ```java
    registrationCCM = {
        "moduleID": MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY,
        "crossChainCommandID": CROSS_CHAIN_COMMAND_ID_REGISTRATION,
        "nonce": 0,
        "sendingChainID": MAINCHAIN_ID,
        "receivingChainID": chainID,
        "fee": 0,
        "status": 0,
        "params": {
            "networkID": SHA-256(trs.params.genesisBlockId || senderAddress),
            "name": trs.params.name,
        }
    }
    ```
  * The rest of the properties, as specified in Interoperability module LIP, are initialized to their default values.
* An entry in the outbox root substore as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP is created as:
  * `storePrefix`: `STORE_PREFIX_OUTBOX_ROOT`.
  * `storeKey`: `uint32be(chainID)`.
  * `storeValue`: The property `sidechainAccount.outbox.root` serialized according to the `outboxRootSchema` schema defined in Introduce Interoperability module LIP.
* An entry in the registered names substore as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP is created as:
  * `storePrefix`: `STORE_PREFIX_REGISTERED_NAMES`.
  * `storeKey`: `sidechainAccount.name` serialized as a utf-8 encoded string.
  * `storeValue`: `chainID `serialized according to `chainIDSchema` schema defined in Introduce Interoperability module LIP.
* An entry in the registered network IDs substore as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP is created as:
  * `storePrefix`: `STORE_PREFIX_NETWORK_ID`.
  * `storeKey`: `sidechainAccount.networkID `serialized as bytes.
  * `storeValue`: `chainID` serialized according to `chainIDSchema` schema defined in Introduce Interoperability module LIP.

#### Verification

Let `trs` be a transaction with module ID `MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY` and command ID `COMMAND_ID_MAINCHAIN_REG` to be verified. The set of validity rules to validate `trs.params` are:

* The `trs.params.ownChainID` property has to be an integer less than or equal to `MAX_UINT32`.
* The `trs.params.ownName` property has to contain only characters from the set `[a-z0-9!@$&_.]` and has to be at most `MAX_LENGTH_NAME` characters long.

  * The array must contain 101 elements (exact number of active delegates on Lisk mainchain).
  * The array must be ordered lexicographically by `blsKey` property.
  * The `blsKey` property of each element has a length of 48 bytes.
  * The `blsKey` property of each element is unique within the array.
  * The `bftWeight` property of each element is equal to 1.

    * Let `b` be the current block and `validators` be an array of objects equal to `bftModule.getBFTParameters(b.header.height).validators`, then:
      * `keyList = [ validatorsModule.getValidatorAccount(validator.address).blsKey for validator in validators]` sorted lexicographically.
      * `weights = [ validator.bftWeight for validator in validators]` sorted according `keyList`.
    * The `tag` is equal to `TAG_CHAIN_REG_MESSAGE`.
    * The `netID` byte array corresponds to the network ID of the chain.
    * The `aggregationBits` argument is the byte array given in `trs.params.aggregationBits`.
    * The `signature` argument is the aggregate signature given in `trs.params.signature`.
    * The `certificateThreshold` argument is equal to `getBFTParameters(b.header.height).certificateThreshold` where `b` is the current block.
    * The `message` argument is the output bytes of the serialization, as specified in [LIP 0027][lip27], of `trs.params.ownChainID`, `trs.params.ownName` and `trs.params.mainchainValidators` properties according to the following schema:

    ```java
    registrationSignatureMessage = {  
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["ownChainID", "ownName", "mainchainValidators"],
        "properties": {
            "ownChainID": {
                "dataType": "uint32",
                "fieldNumber": 1
            },
            "ownName": {
                "dataType": "string",
                "fieldNumber": 2
            },
            "mainchainValidators": {
                "type": "array",
                "fieldNumber": 3,
                "items": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "required": ["blsKey", "bftWeight"],
                    "properties": {
                        "blsKey": {
                            "dataType": "bytes",
                            "fieldNumber": 1
                        },
                        "bftWeight": {
                            "dataType": "uint64",
                            "fieldNumber": 2
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

#### Execution

When a mainchain registration command is applied, new entries of the Interoperability module are created in the sidechain state for the interoperability account, outbox root and own chain stores as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP. In particular, let `trs` be a transaction with module ID `MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY` and command ID `COMMAND_ID_MAINCHAIN_REG` to be executed. Then:

* An entry in the chain data substore as specified in [Introduce Interoperability module LIP][interopAccount] is created as:
  * `storePrefix`: `STORE_PREFIX_CHAIN_DATA`.
  * `storeKey`: `uint32be(MAINCHAIN_ID)`.
  * `storeValue`: `mainchainAccount` where `mainchainAccount` is the chain account object, serialized according to the `chainAccountSchema` schema defined in Introduce Interoperability module LIP, and initialized as:
    * `mainchainAccount.name` = `MAINCHAIN_NAME`.
    * `mainchainAccount.networkID` = `MAINCHAIN_NETWORK_ID`.
    * `mainchainAccount.activeValidators` = `trs.params.mainchainValidators`.
    * `mainchainAccount.certificateThreshold` = `THRESHOLD_MAINCHAIN`.
    * The following [registration CCM][regCCM] is added to `mainchainAccount.outbox` by calling the `addToOutbox(MAINCHAIN_ID, registrationCCM)` logic as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP:

    ```java
    registrationCCM = {
        "moduleID": MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY,
        "crossChainCommandID": CROSS_CHAIN_COMMAND_ID_REGISTRATION,
        "nonce": 0,
        "sendingChainID": chainID,
        "receivingChainID": MAINCHAIN_ID,
        "fee": 0,
        "status": 0,
        "params": {
            "networkID": MAINCHAIN_NETWORK_ID,
            "name": MAINCHAIN_NAME,
        }
    }
    ```
    * The rest of the properties, as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP, are initialized to their default values.
* An entry in the outbox root substore as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP is created as:
  * `storePrefix`: `STORE_PREFIX_OUTBOX_ROOT`.
  * `storeKey`:  `uint32be(MAINCHAIN_ID)`.
  * `storeValue`: The property `mainchainAccount.outbox.root` serialized according to the `outboxRootSchema` schema defined in Introduce Interoperability module LIP.
* An entry in the own chain account data substore as specified in Introduce Interoperability module LIP is created as:
  * `storePrefix` : `STORE_PREFIX_CHAIN_DATA`
  * `storeKey`: `uint32be(0)`.
  * `storeValue`: `ownChain` where `ownChain` is the own chain account object, serialized according to the `ownChainAccountSchema` schema defined in Introduce Interoperability module LIP, and initialized as:
    * `ownChain.ID` = `trs.params.ownChainID`.
    * `ownChain.name` = `trs.params.ownName`.
    * `ownChain.nonce` = 0.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal, together with [Introduce Interoperability module LIP][research:interop-module], [Introduce cross-chain update  mechanism LIP][research:ccu], [Introduce cross-chain messages LIP][research:ccm], and [Introduce sidechain recovery mechanism LIP][research:sidechain-recovery], is part of the Interoperability module. Chains adding this module will need to do so with a hardfork.
