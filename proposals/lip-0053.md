## Abstract

This LIP introduces _cross-chain update transactions_ which are used to post certified information and cross-chain messages in Lisk ecosystem chains.

Cross-chain update transactions are the carriers of the information transmitted between chains. By posting a cross-chain update, the receiving chain gets the information required about the advancement of the sending chain. The transaction can also include cross-chain messages and thus serves as an envelope for messages from one chain to another.

## Motivation

Motivation for the Lisk Interoperability module and the cross-chain update transaction can be found in [LIP 0045][lip-0045].

## Rationale

### Cross-chain Update Transaction Properties

#### sendingChainId

Identifies the chain sending the cross-chain update. Only cross-chain update transactions coming from [registered][lip-0043] chains are valid, registered chains are the ones with an entry in the interoperability store corresponding to their `chainID`.

#### certificate

Used to update the cross-chain account. It must be a certificate with an adequate [BLS signature][lip-0038]. The signature is always validated against the public key set stored in the sending chain account.

It is important to note here that the validation of this signature is done with respect to the network identifier of the sending chain. This network identifier is included in the sending chain account in the interoperability store.

#### activeValidatorsUpdate

The chain account stores an array containing the BLS keys and BFT weights required to validate the certificate signature. This array has to be updated if the validator set changes in the chain sending the certificate. The difference between the stored array and the new one is included in this property.

#### newCertificateThreshold

The chain account stores the threshold required to validate the certificate signature. This certificate threshold has to be updated if its value changes in the chain sending the certificate. In that case, the updated value is set in the `newCertificateThreshold` property of the CCU. If `newCertificateThreshold` is set to `0`, it implies that the certificate threshold has not been changed in the sending chain.

#### inboxUpdate

The `inboxUpdate` contains the information relative to the messages to be included in the sending chain inbox. As specified in [LIP 0045][lip-0045], cross-chain messages are stored in the chain outbox on the sending chain and in the corresponding inbox on the receiving chain. This property contains three elements: the cross-chain messages themselves, an inclusion witness into the outbox root, and an inclusion witness of this outbox root into the state root.

##### crossChainMessages

An array of cross-chain messages. See [LIP 0049][lip-0049] for the general properties and processing of cross-chain messages. The `crossChainMessages` property must contain consecutive messages from the outbox.

##### messageWitness

In the sending chain, all cross-chain messages are added to a regular Merkle tree attested by the outbox root. The `messageWitness` contains two values relative to that Merkle tree:
the `partnerChainOutboxSize`, giving the total messages sent by the partner chain, and the `siblingHashes`, which is part of a regular Merkle proof.

This Merkle proof is required if not all messages necessary to recompute the outbox root were given in `crossChainMessages`. If all messages required to compute the outbox root are included in `crossChainMessages` then `siblingHashes` can be left empty.

##### outboxRootWitness

The outbox root of the sending chain is part of a sparse Merkle tree attested by the state root (provided in the certificate). The `outboxRootWitness` property is an inclusion proof into the state root of the outbox root computed from the receiving chain inbox, `crossChainMessages` and `messageWitness`. If the cross-chain update transaction contains an empty certificate, this property can also be left empty, as the required root was already attested in a previous cross-chain update.

### Posting Cross-chain Updates on Mainchain and on Sidechains

As the roles of both mainchain and sidechain are quite different, so are the transactions used to post cross-chain updates. The most notable differences are:

* On the mainchain, all CCMs included in the `inboxUpdate` must have their `sendingChainID` equal to the chainID sending the cross-chain update.
* On sidechains, all CCMs included in the `inboxUpdate` must have their `receivingChainID` equal to the chainID of the sidechain receiving the cross-chain update.
* As the mainchain accepts CCMs with `receivingChainID` corresponding to another sidechain, the cross-chain update processing on the mainchain is responsible for the inclusion of those CCMs in the corresponding outbox.

These points guarantee that the CCMs are always forwarded to the correct chains and that the receiving chain can be confident that the chain specified in `ccm.sendingChainID` was truly the chain issuing the CCM.

### Creating and Posting Cross-chain Update Transactions

The Lisk consensus mechanism is designed to create and publish certificates regularly. In that regard, obtaining the information required to post a cross-chain update transaction is easy and straightforward. The following is an example workflow that a relayer for a given sidechain could follow.

Setup to gather the required mainchain information:

* Run a mainchain node.
* Maintain a list of all CCMs included in the sidechain outbox. For each height where a CCM was included in the outbox, also save the inclusion witness of the outbox into the state root. All CCMs and witnesses for heights that have been certified on the sidechain can be discarded.
* Maintain a history of all validator changes on the mainchain for rounds that have not yet been certified on the sidechain.

Create a cross-chain update transaction for a given height `h1`:

* Find a [signed certificate][research:certificate-generation] in the mainchain block headers for a height (say `h2`) higher or equal to `h1`. This will be used as the `certificate` property of the transaction.
* The property `inboxUpdate.crossChainMessages` lists all CCMs that have been included in the sidechain outbox up to `h2` (and which have not been included on the sidechain yet). In this case, the `messageWitness` will be empty.
* Compute the inclusion proof for the outbox root of the sidechain account into the mainchain state root. This proof is then used to compute `inboxUpdate.outboxRootWitness`.
* Compute the required update to the active validators stored in the chain account and the validators that were used to create `certificate.validatorsHash`. This update can be obtained by following the logic of `getActiveValidatorsDiff` as detailed in the [Appendix](#appendix).
* If the `certificateThreshold` used to create `certificate.validatorsHash` is different from the one stored in the chain account, include the new value in the `newCertificateThreshold` property.
* Post the cross-chain update transaction on the sidechain.

Relayers should post cross-chain update transactions on the sidechain when the need for it arises. This can be either because some CCMs have been included in the outbox and need to be relayed, or when the mainchain validators changes require the channel to be updated on the sidechain.

The role of relayer is totally symmetric for relaying information from a sidechain to the mainchain.

#### Posting Partial Cross-chain Updates

The Lisk protocol allows relayers to post cross-chain update transactions which do not contain all CCMs, as opposed to the mechanism explained in the previous section. This can be useful for example when the list of CCMs is too large to be included in a single block.

The cross-chain update transaction can contain an `inboxUpdate` which does not contain all CCMs required to recompute the outbox root corresponding to the given state root. In that case, the relayer has to make sure that an appropriate `messageWitness` is provided. This witness is constructed as a right witness as defined in [LIP 0031](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/main/proposals/lip-0031.md).

If a cross-chain update was submitted without all the CCMs (as explained in the previous paragraph), then it is possible to provide those missing CCMs without the need to provide another `certificate` or `outboxRootWitness` (technically an empty `certificate` and `outboxRootWitness` are provided). The cross-chain update transaction contains only the missing CCMs and the potential `messageWitness`.

Those options for partial cross-chain update transactions are not expected to be used regularly. It is however a good option in corner case events where the sidechain outbox suddenly becomes very large.

#### Malicious Cross-chain Update Transactions

A cross-chain update transaction may have been created with validly signed information according to the [validity rules](#parameters-validity) and hence be included in the blockchain. However, the transaction could include invalid CCMs. Those will be detected when trying to process the `inboxUpdate`. 

If a CCM is invalid (as specified in the ["Execute Cross-chain Updates" section](#execute-cross-chain-updates)), then the sending chain is [terminated][lip-0045#termination].
The CCU processing then continues and CCMs from other chains are applied. 
All CCMs from terminated chains have no effect, they are neither applied nor forwarded.

#### First Cross-chain Update from a Sidechain

The first cross-chain update containing messages from a given chain has a special function. It will change the sending chain status from `CHAIN_REGISTERED` to `CHAIN_ACTIVE`. This change means that the receiving chain is now available to receive cross-chain messages and can interact with the sending chain. Additionally, once active, sidechains must follow the liveness condition and regularly post cross-chain updates on the mainchain (at least once every 30 days). If the sidechain fails to follow the liveness condition, it is terminated on the mainchain.

When a sidechain is started and registered, the sidechain developers might decide to not activate the sidechain straight away (maybe to do further testing). It could happen then (intentionally or not) that an old block header (almost 30 days old) is submitted to the mainchain to activate the sidechain. This could result in the sidechain being terminated for liveness failure very soon after the activation (maybe only a few minutes later). To prevent this issue (and without any significant drawbacks) the first cross-chain update to be submitted on mainchain must contain a certificate less that 15 days old. The sidechain has therefore at least 15 days to submit the next cross-chain update to the mainchain and start the regular posting of cross-chain updates.

## Specification

The Interoperability module supports two commands used to certify the state of another chain. Those commands have `moduleID = MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY`. One of them, meant to be posted on the mainchain, has `commandID = COMMAND_ID_MAINCHAIN_CCU`, while the other, meant to be posted on sidechains, has `commandID = COMMAND_ID_SIDECHAIN_CCU`.

### Constants and Notations

The following constants are used throughout the document:

| Name                                                     | Type   | Value                   |

| **Message Tags**                                         |        |                         |
| `MESSAGE_TAG_CERTIFICATE `                               | bytes  | "LSK_CE_" ASCII-encoded |

Several of those constants are shared with the other LIPs defining the Interoperability module and all of the needed constants for the Interoperability module are defined in [LIP 0045][lip-0045]. That LIP should be considered correct if a value stated here differs.

#### uint32be Function

The function `uint32be(x)` returns the big endian uint32 serialization of an integer `x`, with `0 <= x < 2^32`. This serialization is always 4 bytes long.

### Parameters Schema

Both commands will use the following `params` schema:

```java

    ],

                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "newCertificateThreshold": {

            "required": [
                "crossChainMessages",
                "messageWitness",
                "outboxRootWitness"
            ],
            "properties": {
                "crossChainMessages": {
                    "type": "array",
                    "fieldNumber": 1,
                    "items": {"dataType": "bytes"}
                },
                "messageWitness": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "fieldNumber": 2,
                    "required": ["partnerChainOutboxSize", "siblingHashes"],
                    "properties": {
                        "partnerChainOutboxSize": {
                            "dataType": "uint64",
                            "fieldNumber": 1
                        },
                        "siblingHashes": {
                            "type": "array",
                            "fieldNumber": 2,
                            "items": {"dataType": "bytes"}
                        }
                    }
                },
                "outboxRootWitness": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "fieldNumber": 3,
                    "required": ["bitmap", "siblingHashes"],
                    "properties": {
                        "bitmap": {
                            "dataType": "bytes",
                            "fieldNumber": 1
                        },
                        "siblingHashes": {
                            "type": "array",
                            "fieldNumber": 2,
                            "items": {"dataType": "bytes"}
			                  }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the following, we use the notation: 

* let `CCU` be the cross-chain update transaction.
* let `inboxUpdate = CCU.params.inboxUpdate`.
* let `partnerChainID = CCU.params.sendingChainID`.
* let `partnerChain = chainAccount(partnerChainID)`.
* let `partnerChannel = channel(partnerChainID)`.
* let `partnerValidators = validators(partnerChainID)`.

### Parameters Validity

#### Liveness of Partner Chain

A CCU transaction is only valid if the partner chain is not terminated and follows the [liveness rule][lip-0045#livenessCondition]. This is done by asserting the two points below:  

* `partnerChain.status != CHAIN_TERMINATED`,
* if `partnerChain.status == CHAIN_ACTIVE` then also validate `isLive(partnerChainID) == True`. The `isLive` function is specified in [LIP 0045][lip-0045].
 
##### Liveness Requirement for the First CCU

If `partnerChain.status == CHAIN_REGISTERED`, all proposed CCUs must contain a non-empty `certificate` which must follow the schema defined in  [LIP 0061][research:certificate-generation]. In the following, let `certificate` be the deserialized certificate.

Furthermore, if the CCU also contains a non-empty `inboxUpdate`, the certificate is only valid if it allows the sidechain account to remain live for a reasonable amount of time. This is done by checking that:

```python
timestamp - CCU.params.certificate.timestamp < LIVENESS_LIMIT / 2
```

where `timestamp` is the timestamp of the block including the CCU.

#### Certificate and Validators Update Validity

If `params` contains a non-empty `certificate`, it is valid if:

* `params.certificate` follows the schema defined in [LIP 0061][research:certificate-generation]. Again, we write `certificate` for the deserialized certificate.
* `certificate.height` is greater than `partnerChain.lastCertificate.height`.
* `certificate.timestamp < timestamp`, where timestamp is the timestamp of the block including the CCU.
* `certificate.signature` is a valid aggregate signature for the `partnerValidators.activeValidators` property of the cross-chain account. This is done by verifying that the function below defined in the [LIP 0038][lip-0038#verifyWeightedAggSig] returns `VALID`.

```python
verifyWeightedAggSig(
    keysList          = [validator.blsKey for validator in partnerValidators.activeValidators],
    aggregationBits   = certificate.aggregationBits,
    signature         = certificate.signature,
    tag               = MESSAGE_TAG_CERTIFICATE,
    networkIdentifier = partnerChain.networkID,
    weights           = [validator.bftWeight for validator in partnerValidators.activeValidators],
    threshold         = partnerValidators.certificateThreshold,
    message           = params.certificate
)
```

If `params` contains a non-empty `activeValidatorsUpdate` property (with deserialized value not equal to `{activeValidatorsUpdate:[]}`), or a non-zero `newCertificateThreshold`, `params` is valid if:

* `params` contains a non-empty `certificate`.
* `params.activeValidatorsUpdate` has the correct format:
  * for all `activeValidator` in `params.activeValidatorsUpdate` we have that `activeValidator.blsKey` is a BLS public key, hence it is 48 bytes long.
  * every `activeValidator` in `params.activeValidatorsUpdate` has a different `activeValidator.blsKey`.
  * `params.activeValidatorsUpdate` is in lexicographical order of `blsKey`.
* `certificate.validatorsHash == bft.computeValidatorsHash(newActiveValidators, newCertificateThreshold)` where
  * `newActiveValidators` is obtained as `partnerValidators.activeValidators` updated with `params.activeValidatorsUpdate`, see ["Update Active Validators" section](#update-active-validators) below.
  * `newCertificateThreshold` is `params.newCertificateThreshold` if it is non-zero, `partnerValidators.certificateThreshold` otherwise.

#### InboxUpdate Validity

If `params` contains a non-empty `certificate` and an `inboxUpdate`, the validity of the latter is checked by:

* Let `newInboxRoot`, `newInboxAppendPath` and `newInboxSize` be the resulting new root, append path and size of the Merkle tree that would be obtained if all messages from `crossChainMessages` would be appended to the `partnerChannel` inbox. Note that `partnerChannel.inbox` is not updated here.
* If `inboxUpdate` contains a non-empty `messageWitness`, then update `newInboxRoot` to the output of `calculateRootFromRightWitness(newInboxSize, newInboxAppendPath, inboxUpdate.messageWitness.siblingHashes)` as specified in [LIP 0031](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0031.md).
* Then validate the newly updated root against the certificate state root using the provided `outboxRootWitness`. Using notation from [LIP 0039][lip-0039], this is done via the function `verify(queryKeys, proof, certificate.stateRoot)` with:

```python
queryKeys = [outboxKey],

proof = {
    siblingHashes: outboxRootWitness.siblingHashes,
    queries: [{
        key: outboxKey,
        value: newInboxRoot,
        bitmap: outboxRootWitness.bitmap
    }],
}

outboxKey = MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY
            || STORE_PREFIX_OUTBOX
            || SHA-256(uint32be(partnerChainID)).
```

If `params` contains an empty `certificate` and a non-empty `inboxUpdate`, the validity of the latter is checked as follows:

* Let `newInboxRoot`, `newInboxAppendPath` and `newInboxSize` be the resulting new root, append path and size of the Merkle tree that would be obtained if all messages from `crossChainMessages` would be appended to the `partnerChannel` inbox. Note that `partnerChannel.inbox` is not updated here.
* If `inboxUpdate` contains a `messageWitness`, then update `newInboxRoot` to the output of `calculateRootFromRightWitness(newInboxSize, newInboxAppendPath, inboxUpdate.messageWitness.siblingHashes)` as specified in [LIP 0031](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0031.md).
* Then validate that `newInboxRoot == partnerChannel.partnerChainOutboxRoot`.

### Execute Cross-chain Updates

Cross-chain updates posted on the mainchain or sidechains follow a different execution logic, which we describe in the following two subsections, and a common one, described in the ["Common Processing" section](#common-processing).

#### Cross-chain Updates Posted on Mainchain

A cross-chain update transaction, `ccu`, posted on mainchain is a transaction with:

* `moduleID = MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY`,
* `commandID  = COMMAND_ID_MAINCHAIN_CCU`.

Then, the following is done in the given order:

* If `partnerChain.status == CHAIN_REGISTERED` and `inboxUpdate` is non-empty:
  * If the first CCM in `inboxUpdate` is a <code>[registration CCM][lip-0049#registrationMessage]</code> `ccm` with `ccm.receivingChainID == MAINCHAIN_ID`:  
  set `partnerChain.status = CHAIN_ACTIVE`.
  * Else: <code>[terminateChainInternal][lip-0045#terminateChainInternal](partnerChainID)</code>.
* For every `ccm` in `inboxUpdate.crossChainMessages`:
  * If `partnerChainID != ccm.sendingChainID` or <code>[validateFormat][lip-0049#validateFormat](ccm) != True</code>:  
  <code>[terminateChainInternal][lip-0045#terminateChainInternal](partnerChainID)</code>.
  * If `ccm.receivingChainID != MAINCHAIN_ID`:  
  <code>[forward][lip-0049#forward](ccu, ccm)</code>.
  * If `ccm.receivingChainID == MAINCHAIN_ID`:  
  <code>[apply][lip-0049#apply](ccu, ccm)</code>.
* Continue the processing by executing all steps in the ["Common Processing" section](#common-processing).

#### Cross-chain Updates Posted on Sidechains

A cross-chain update transaction, `ccu`, posted on a sidechain is a transaction with:

* `moduleID = MODULE_ID_INTEROPERABILITY`,
* `commandID = COMMAND_ID_SIDECHAIN_CCU`.

To execute cross-chain updates, the following is done:

* If `partnerChain.status == CHAIN_REGISTERED` and `inboxUpdate` is non-empty:
  * If the first CCM in `inboxUpdate` is a <code>[registration CCM][lip-0049#registrationMessage]</code> `ccm` with `ccm.sendingChainID == patnerChainID`:    
  set `partnerChain.status = CHAIN_ACTIVE`.
  * Else: <code>[terminateChainInternal][lip-0045#terminateChainInternal](partnerChainID)</code>. Exit the transaction processing, the CCU has no further effect.
* For every `ccm` in `inboxUpdate.crossChainMessages`, respecting the order of the array:
  * If `ownChainAccount.ID != ccm.receivingChainID` or <code>[validateFormat][lip-0049#validateFormat](ccm) != True</code>:  
  <code>[terminateChainInternal][lip-0045#terminateChainInternal](partnerChainID)</code>.
  * <code>[apply][lip-0049#apply](ccu, ccm)</code>.
* Continue the processing by executing all steps in the ["Common Processing" section](#common-processing).

#### Common Processing

For CCU transactions posted on the mainchain or on sidechains, once the specific execution steps described above have been completed, the following is done in the given order:

* Set `partnerValidators.activeValidators = updateActiveValidators(partnerValidators.activeValidators, activeValidatorsUpdate)` as specified in the ["Update Active Validators" section](#update-active-validators).
* If `newCertificateThreshold != 0`, update `partnerValidators.certificateThreshold` to `newCertificateThreshold`.
* If `params` contains a non-empty `certificate`: 
  * Set `partnerChain.lastCertificate.stateRoot` to `certificate.stateRoot`.
  * Set `partnerChain.lastCertificate.timestamp` to `certificate.timestamp`.
  * Set `partnerChain.lastCertificate.height` to `certificate.height`.
  * Set `partnerChain.lastCertificate.validatorsHash` to `certificate.validatorsHash`.
* Set `partnerChannel.partnerChainOutboxRoot` to:
  * `calculateRootFromRightWitness(inbox.size, inbox.appendPath, inboxUpdate.messageWitness.siblingHashes)` if `params` contains a non-empty `inboxUpdate.messageWitness`, this function is defined in [LIP 0031][lip-0031#rightWitness].
  * `partnerChannel.inbox.root` otherwise.

### Update Active Validators

Updating `partnerValidators.activeValidators` with respect to a given `activeValidatorsUpdate` is done following the logic below:

```python
updateActiveValidators(activeValidators, activeValidatorsUpdate)
    for validator in activeValidatorsUpdate:
        if there exist currentValidator in activeValidators such that
        validators.blsKey == currentValidator.blsKey:
            set currentValidator.bftWeight = validators.bftWeight
        else:
            add validator to activeValidators maintaining the entries in
            lexicographical order of blsKeys

    remove any entry activeValidators with bftWeight == 0
    return activeValidators
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal, together with [LIP 0043][lip-0043], [LIP 0049][lip-0049], and [LIP 0054][lip-0054], is part of the Interoperability module. Chains adding this module will need to do so with a hard fork.

## Reference Implementation

TBA

### Computing the Validators Update

When posting a CCU transaction, the validators hash given in the certificate certifies the new set of validators of the sending chain. The CCU must therefore include the difference between the validators currently stored in the chain account and the validator set authenticated by the certificate. The required `activeValidatorsUpdate` can be obtained by applying the function below. We suppose that `currentValidators` and `newValidators` follow the `activeValidators` schema given above.

```python
getActiveValidatorsDiff(currentValidators, newValidators):
    activeValidatorsUpdate = []

    for newValidator in newValidators.activeValidators:
        if there exist currentValidator in currentValidators.activeValdators such that
        newValidator.blsKey == currentValidator.blsKey
	and newValidator.bftWeight == currentValidator.bftWeight:
            continue
        else:
            append newValidator to activeValidatorsUpdate

    for currentValidator in currentValidators:
        if there exist newValidators in currentValidators.activeValdators such that
        newValidator.blsKey == currentValidator.blsKey:
            continue
        else:
            append {"blsKey": currentValidator.blsKey, "bftWeight": 0} to activeValidatorsUpdate

    return activeValidatorsUpdate
```
