## Abstract

The Random module handles the validation of the inputs and computation of outputs for the commit and reveal process for a Lisk blockchain. In this LIP, we specify the state transitions logic defined within this module, i.e., the protocol logic injected during the block lifecycle, and the functions that can be called from other modules or off-chain services.

## Motivation

The Random module handles the validation of the inputs for the commit and reveal process introduced in [LIP 0022][lip-0022#randomSeeds] as well as the computation of the random seeds from that process. In this LIP we specify the properties, serialization, and default values of the Random module, as well as the protocol logic processed during a block lifecycle, and the functions exposed to other modules and to off-chain services.

## Rationale

### Random Module Store

The Random module defines a random substore whose value contains the validator reveals array. This array contains the necessary information to:

* validate the seeds revealed by the validators as part of [the commit and reveal process][lip-0022#randao], and
* compute the random seed to be used as source of randomness to re-order the generator list for a new round (both in PoA and DPoS chains) and to select the standby delegates (in certain DPoS chains as well as the Lisk mainchain).

This array has a bounded length that is given as part of the configuration of the Random module. On one hand, when a new block is executed, a new element is added to this array. On the other hand, the old revealed seeds are in most of the cases deleted from the array since they are not needed anymore.

It is worth noting that random seed computation from this commit and reveal process can be used for other applications that need a source of randomness. However, this random seed has [certain limitations][lip-0022#mitigating-last-revealer] that have to be taken into account as explained in LIP 0022. Certain applications may require a different source of randomness to be secure.

## Specification

In this section, we specify the substores that are part of the Random module store, and the protocol logic called during the block lifecycle.

The Random module has module ID `MODULE_ID_RANDOM` (see the table below). It is a module with no dependencies.

### Constants and config parameters

| `MODULE_ID_RANDOM `            | uint32   | TBD             | ID of the Random module                        |
| `STORE_PREFIX_RANDOM`          | bytes    | `0x0000`        | Prefix of the random substore                  |

| `MAX_LENGTH_VALIDATOR_REVEALS` | uint32   | 206             | Maximum length of the `validatorReveals` array |

### Random Module Store

The key-value pairs in the module store are organized in the following substore.

#### Random Substore

##### Store Prefix, Store Key, and Store Value

The entry in the random substore is defined as follows:

* The store prefix is set to `STORE_PREFIX_RANDOM`.
* The store key is set to empty bytes.
* The store value is the serialization of an object following the JSON schema `seedRevealSchema` presented below.

##### Seed Reveal Schema

```java
seedRevealSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "validatorReveals": {
            "type": "array",
            "fieldNumber": 1,
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "generatorAddress": {
                        "dataType": "bytes",
                        "fieldNumber": 1
                    },
                    "seedReveal": {
                        "dataType": "bytes",
                        "fieldNumber": 2
                    },
                    "height": {
                        "dataType": "uint32",
                        "fieldNumber": 3
                    },
                    "valid": {
                        "dataType": "boolean",
                        "fieldNumber": 4
                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "generatorAddress",
                    "seedReveal",
                    "height",
                    "valid"]
            }
        },
        "required": ["validatorReveals"]
    }
 }
```

##### Properties

In this section, we describe the properties in the `validatorReveals` array of the seed reveal object:

* `generatorAddress`: The address of the generator of the block. A valid generator address is 20 bytes long.
* `seedReveal`: The value revealed by the generator of the block for the commit and reveal process. A valid seed reveal is 16 bytes long.
* `height`: The height of the block where the generator added their revealed seed.
* `valid`: The flag stating the validity of `seedReveal` for the random seed computation.

The `validatorReveals` array is  kept ordered by increasing value of height.

### Internal Functions

The Random module has the following internal functions.

#### Hashing Function

A new hashing function, `H`, is defined for this module.

##### Parameters

* `input`: A bytes value of arbitrary length.

##### Returns

The function returns a 16-bytes value, `digest`.

##### Execution

```python
H(input):
    t = SHA-256(input)
    digest = trunc(t)
    return digest
```

where the function `trunc` truncates its input to the 16 most significant bytes.

#### isSeedValidInput

This function assesses the validity of the revealed seed as input for the random seed computation.

##### Parameters

* `generatorAddress`: A 20-bytes value with the address of the generator of a certain block.
* `seedReveal`: A 16-bytes value with the seed revealed by the generator of a certain block.

##### Returns

This function returns `true` if `seedReveal` is valid input for the random seed computation, otherwise, `false`.

##### Execution

```python
isSeedValidInput(generatorAddress, seedReveal):
    let seedObject be an element in validatorReveals array
    let lastSeed be the seedObject with the largest seedObject.height and seedObject.generatorAddress == generatorAddress
    if not lastSeed:
        return false
    if lastSeed.seedReveal == H(seedReveal):
        return true
    return false
```

### Commands

This module does not define any command.

### Protocol Logic for Other Modules

The Random module exposes the following logic to other modules.

#### isSeedRevealValid

This function assesses the validity of the `seedReveal` property of a block.

##### Parameters

* `generatorAddress`: A 20-bytes value with the address of the generator of a certain block.
* `seedReveal`: A 16-bytes value with the seed revealed by the generator of a certain block.

##### Returns

This function returns `true` if `seedReveal` was correctly revealed, otherwise, `false`.

##### Execution

It is specified as:

```python
isSeedRevealValid(generatorAddress, seedReveal):
    let seedObject be an element in validatorReveals array
    let lastSeed be the seedObject with the largest seedObject.height and seedObject.generatorAddress == generatorAddress
    if not lastSeed:
        return true
    if lastSeed.seedReveal == H(seedReveal):
        return true
    return false
```

#### getRandomBytes

This function is used to return the random seed as a 32-bytes value.

##### Parameters

* `height`: An integer with the height of a certain block.
* `numberOfSeeds`: An integer with the number of seeds to consider for the computation.

##### Returns

`randomSeed`: A 32-bytes value representing the random seed.

##### Execution

It is specified as:

```python
getRandomBytes(height, numberOfSeeds):
    randomSeed = H(height + numberOfSeeds)
    let currentSeeds be an array with every seedObject element in validatorReveals so that height <= seedObject.height <= height + numberOfSeeds
    for every seedObject element in currentSeeds:
        if seedObject.valid == true:
            randomSeed = randomSeed XOR seedObject.seedReveal
    return randomSeed
```

### Endpoints for Off-Chain Services

The Random module exposes the following function.

#### IsSeedRevealValid

This function has exactly the same logic, inputs and outputs as the `isSeedRevealValid` function specified in [the previous section](#isSeedRevealValid).

### Protocol Logic During Block Lifecycle

#### After Genesis Block Execution

After the genesis block `g` is executed, the following logic is executed:

* Set the `validatorReveals` array to an empty array.

#### Block Verification

As part of the verification of a block `b`, the following checks are applied. If the checks fail the block is discarded and has no further effect. This logic is not called during the block creation process.

Let `blockAssetBytes` be the bytes included in the block asset for the Random module:

1. Let `blockAssetObject` be the deserialization of `blockAssetBytes` according to `blockHeaderAssetRandomModule` in the [Block Initialization](#block-initialization) subsection.
2. The property `blockAssetObject.seedReveal` has to have a length of 20 bytes.

#### After Block Execution

After a block `b` is executed, the following logic is applied:

* While the size of the `validatorReveals` array is larger than `MAX_LENGTH_VALIDATOR_REVEALS`, delete the element of `validatorReveals` array with the smallest value of `height`.
  * By construction this should be the first element of the `validatorReveals` array.
  * The value of the `MAX_LENGTH_VALIDATOR_REVEALS` constant is given in the initial configuration of the Random module. It should be set as twice the maximum length of the chains validator set.
* Add a new element to the `validatorReveals` array with the following content:
  * `seedReveal = blockAssetObject.seedReveal`
  * `generatorAddress = b.header.generatorAddress`
  * `height = b.header.height`
  * `valid = isSeedValidInput(b.header.generatorAddress, blockAssetObject.seedReveal)`

where the `isSeedValidInput` is the internal function specified above.

### Block Creation

#### Block Initialization

The asset data created by the Random module contains a serialized object following the `blockHeaderAssetRandomModule` schema where the property `seedReveal`, the seed revealed by the block generator, is set by the module. This can be done by implementing the hash onion algorithm introduced in the [Appendix B of LIP 0022][lip-0022#hash-onion-computation].

 ```java
blockHeaderAssetRandomModule = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "seedReveal": {
            "dataType": "bytes",
            "fieldNumber": 1
        }
    },
    "required": ["seedReveal"]
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This LIP defines a new store interface for the Random module, which in turn will become part of the state tree and will be authenticated by the state root. As such, it will induce a hardfork.
