## Abstract

We introduce the concept of message tags for signatures. These message tags are prepended to the binary messages before being signed. A unique tag has to be used for each message type (transaction, block header, etc.), and in particular for each schema. This ensures that a signature for one message cannot be a valid signature for another message that serializes to the same binary message.

Moreover, we generalize the usage of the network identifiers, which are currently used for transaction and block header signatures, to arbitrary signatures. This will prevent replay attacks for arbitrary messages.

## Motivation

We want to avoid (1) replay attacks and (2) the re-usage of a signature for a different message of a different type.

Case (2) could happen if there are two messages that are of different types but are serialized to the same binary message. For example, consider a block header `bh` that is serialized to the binary message `bm`. If the binary message `bm` can be deserialized against a transaction schema to a transaction `tx`, then a signature of `bh` would also be a valid signature of `tx` for the generator public key of `bh`. Note that for several reasons it is very unlikely that a concrete instance of this example passes block validation for `bh` and transaction validation for `tx`. For instance, the current schemas do not allow that`bh.generatorPublicKey` and `tx.senderPublicKey` are encoded in the same position of the binary message.

Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to prevent such re-usage cases in general. In particular for new data structures that require a signature introduced by some future protocol enhancements.

Replay attacks for transactions and blocks, i.e. replaying transactions or blocks on other chains, are already addressed by [LIP 0009](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0009.md) and [LIP 0024](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0024.md#update-to-the-block-header-signing-procedure) respectively. However, replay attacks should be prevented for any kind of data structure for the same reason as above.

## Rationale

### Message Tags

Prepending a tag to a binary message before signing, where the tag is specific to the type of the message, prevents the signature re-usage in general. Consider again the blockheader `bh` and the transaction `tx` that are serialized to the same binary message `bm`. When the tag `"LSK_BH_"` is used for block header signatures and the tag `"LSK_TX_"` for transaction signatures, then the signatures for `bh` and `tx` are computed by signing the messages `"LSK_BH_" || bm` and `"LSK_TX_" || bm` respectively, where `"||"` denotes concatenation. Hence, the signature of `bh` cannot be a valid signature for `tx` and vice versa (assuming no collisions in the signing function).

Note that any updates to the serialization specification of a message type must be accompanied by introducing a new tag. For example, when the [transaction schema](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0028.md#transactionschema-schema) is updated, a new tag like `"LSK_TX:V2_"` must be defined and used.

### Network Identifiers

Network identifiers for transaction signatures and block signatures were already introduced in [LIP 0009](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0009.md#specification) and [LIP 0024](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0024.md#update-to-the-block-header-signing-procedure) respectively to prevent replay attacks on other chains. Here, we specify how to use a network identifier for any kind of message to prevent replay attacks on other chains in general.

## Specification

### Message Tags

Every binary message must be tagged before being signed. This is done as specified by the function `tagMessage` in the pseudo code below: A specific ASCII-encoded tag and a network identifier as specified in [LIP 0009](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0009.md#specification) are prepended to the message.

```python
tagMessage(tag, networkIdentifier, message):
    return tag || networkIdentifier || message
```

The tag is chosen depending on the message type. Moreover, different serialization methods for the same message type require different tags. The following table defines the tags currently needed.

**message type**                                                                                                                                     | **tag**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------
transaction with serialization as specified in [LIP 0028](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0028.md#transactionschema-schema) | "LSK_TX_"
block header with serialization as specified in [LIP 0029](https://github.com/LiskHQ/lips/blob/master/proposals/lip-0029.md#blockheader-schema)      | "LSK_BH_"

#### Creating New Tags

When a new tag is required in the future, the format

    "LSK_" || TAG || "_"

has to be used where:

- Strings in double quotes are ASCII-encoded literals.
- TAG is a unique string indicating the scheme and, optionally, additional information, e.g., to specify a version number as shown [above](#message-tags). TAG must contain only ASCII characters between 0x21 and 0x7e (inclusive), except that it must not contain underscore (0x5f).

### Signing and Verifying with Ed25519

Let [`Sign`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.6) and [`Verify`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032#section-5.1.7) be the signing and verifying functions of Ed25519 as specified in [RFC 8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032). Then the signature for a binary message `m` and a secret key `sk` is generated by `signMessage(sk, tag, networkIdentifier, m)` as defined below. `tag` must be the correct message tag for `m` and `networkIdentifier` the correct network identifier for the chain. The resulting signature `sig` in combination with the message `m` and the matching public key `pk` is verified by `verifyMessageSig(pk, tag, networkIdentifier, m, sig)`.

```python
signMessage(sk, tag, networkIdentifier, m):
    taggedMessage = tagMessage(tag, networkIdentifier, m)
    return Sign(sk, taggedMessage)

verifyMessageSig(pk, tag, networkIdentifier, m, sig):
    taggedMessage = tagMessage(tag, networkIdentifier, m)
    return Verify(pk, taggedMessage, sig)
```

## Backwards Compatibility

Due to adding message tags to transaction and block signatures, the proposed signature scheme is incompatible with the current one and implies a hard fork.
