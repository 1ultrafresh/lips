## Abstract

The Interoperability module provides basic functionalities to transmit information between interoperable chains in the Lisk ecosystem using cross-chain messages. In this LIP the properties, serialization, and initial values of this module are specified. Additionally, this LIP also provides a broad overview of the Lisk interoperability solution, motivating several design choices and presenting the new commands that are part of the Interoperability module.

## Motivation

Interoperability has the potential to solve the scaling issue of blockchains: Instead of deploying applications and their corresponding commands onto a single blockchain, these are implemented into separate blockchains which then communicate with each other using an interoperability protocol.

To achieve interoperability, chains in the Lisk ecosystem (the mainchain and the sidechains participating in interoperability) exchange information via _cross-chain transactions_. As an example, a user can issue a cross-chain transaction to transfer part of its mainchain LSK balance to a sidechain, and subsequently use it to issue one of the sidechain custom commands.

In the Lisk protocol, cross-chain transactions are special in that, after being included in their origin ledger, some new data structures, the _cross-chain messages_ (CCMs), are created, which are transmitted to other chains via special commands called _cross-chain update_ (CCU) commands. CCUs also contain information about the chain, in the form of a _certificate_.

One of the main motivations for proposing a [certificate-based communication](https://lisk.com/blog/research/introduction-blockchain-interoperability) between chains is the ability for all chains in the ecosystem to remain state machines. This means that all information needed to validate and advance a chain to the next block is present on the chain itself.  In the Lisk interoperability solution, the only information that needs social consensus is information about the initial validators of the other chain. On the mainchain, this information is received via the sidechain registration command; on sidechains, in a similar way, via the mainchain registration command.

The Interoperability module provides the data structures and functionalities necessary for interoperability between chains of the Lisk ecosystem. In this LIP, we specify the properties, serialization, and initial values of the Interoperability module.

## Rationale

### Interoperability Commands

The Interoperability module stores the properties necessary to validate and process the following new commands.

#### [Sidechain Registration Command][lip-0043]

The sidechain registration command is used to register a sidechain on the Lisk mainchain. When this command is processed, a new account for the sidechain is created in the mainchain state under the interoperability store. The account is initialized with an empty inbox and outbox, while the sidechain name and the initial validators set are given in the command parameters. The network ID is calculated from the address of the command sender and the genesis block ID, also given in the command parameters.

#### [Mainchain Registration Command][lip-0043]

The mainchain registration command is used to register the Lisk mainchain on a sidechain. When this command is processed, a new account for the mainchain is created in the sidechain state under the interoperability store. The account is initialized with an empty inbox and outbox, while the initial validators set is given in the command parameters. The name and network ID of the mainchain are global protocol constants in the whole ecosystem.

This command also initializes another data structure in the interoperability store, containing some information about the sidechain itself. In particular, it sets the sidechain name and chain ID to the ones that have been previously registered on the mainchain via the sidechain registration command.

#### [Cross-Chain Update Commands][lip-0053]

<img src="lip-0045/ccu.png" width="80%">

_Figure 1: A sketch of an interoperability interaction between the Lisk mainchain and a sidechain. Information (cross-chain messages and updated state) from mainchain blocks (light blue) is collected into a cross-chain update command by the relayer, which then posts it on the sidechain._

CCUs are used to post the updated state of the sending chain on the receiving chain. Furthermore, they transmit the cross-chain messages that need to be sent to the receiving chain (see Figure 1). We introduce two different CCUs, one for posting on the Lisk mainchain, and the other for posting on sidechains. They differ in the way the included messages are handled: on the mainchain, messages targeting another sidechain are forwarded to that sidechain outbox, while messages targeting the mainchain are simply processed. On the other hand, a CCU posted on a sidechain can only contain CCMs targeting that sidechain, being invalid otherwise.


#### [State Recovery Command][lip-0054]

This command is used to recover a certain state (for example fungible and non-fungible tokens) from a sidechain that has been terminated. The user proves the existence of an entry in the terminated state substore with an inclusion proof. The proof is validated against the current state root stored in the terminated chain account. The recovery of the state is then handled by the relevant module (for example the token module would refund the user).

#### [Message Recovery Command][lip-0054]

This command is used to recover a pending message from the outbox of a terminated chain. The user proves with an inclusion proof that the message is in the terminated sidechain outbox. The proof is validated against the outbox root stored in the terminated outbox account. The recovered message is then bounced back to the original sending chain or processed directly (if the sending chain is the mainchain).

#### [State Recovery Initialization Command][lip-0054]

This command is used to initialize a terminated state account on a sidechain. The user proves with an inclusion proof that the target chain state on the mainchain implies that that chain is terminated (either the status is set to 'terminated' or the liveness condition is violated). Once the terminated state account has been initialized, the state recovery command can be issued in the sidechain.

#### [Message Recovery Initialization Command][lip-0054]

This command is used to initialize a terminated outbox account and can only be issued after the corresponding terminated state account has been created. This command contains the chain account of the current chain as stored in the state of the terminated chain and an inclusion proof for it against the state root stored in the corresponding terminated state account. Once the terminated outbox account has been initialized, the message recovery command can be issued.

### Liveness Condition

Active sidechains are required to prove their liveness to the mainchain at least once every 30 days. This is done by including a CCU on the mainchain. If a sidechain does not post a CCU within 30 days, the sidechain account is terminated. This rule guarantees that users do not send funds to inactive sidechains and that users who have tokens in a sidechain which stops communicating with the ecosystem can recover their tokens.

### Life Cycle of a Sidechain

The life cycle of a sidechain can be split into 3 parts, corresponding to the 3 values of the account status property: ''registered'', ''active'', and ''terminated''.

A sidechain registers on the mainchain with a [sidechain registration command][lip-0043]. This command creates the sidechain account on the mainchain. In particular, it creates an entry in the chain data substore, with initial status set to 'registered'; an entry in the channel data substore, with empty inbox and outbox; and an entry in the validators data substore, holding the initial sidechain validators set. Thereafter, the mainchain account is similarly created on a sidechain with a [mainchain registration command][lip-0043].

After a sidechain has been registered on the mainchain, it cannot receive any cross-chain message and does not need to follow the liveness rule, until the first sidechain CCU has been included in the mainchain. At this point, the status of the sidechain account on the mainchain is updated to ''active'' and the liveness requirement is enforced.

If no CCU is received within 30 days, the [chain account is terminated](#terminateChain) and no more CCMs can be sent to or received from the sidechain. A sidechain account can also be terminated if the sidechain posts a CCU containing a CCM with an invalid schema or with an invalid sending chain ID. A message targeting a terminated chain is bounced on the mainchain instead of being forwarded. When this happens, a ''terminated sidechain'' message is emitted by the mainchain, targeting the original sending chain. When this message is processed, the chain is also terminated in the sending chain, blocking future messages.

When a chain is terminated, a 'terminated state' account is created, storing the last certified state root of the terminated chain. Then, users can recover tokens from the terminated sidechain with a state recovery command or proceed with the message recovery initialization command to kick-off the recovery of pending cross-chain messages.

### Properties of the Interoperability Module

Each interoperable sidechain maintains a chain account, channel, and the chain validators for the mainchain, while the mainchain maintains these data structures for each registered sidechain. Correspondingly, on a sidechain we denote with ''partner chain'' the mainchain, while on the mainchain we denote with ''partner chain'' the relevant sidechain.

Each chain also includes an account storing the chain name and ID in the ecosystem as well as the current chain nonce. This ''own chain'' account is present by default in the mainchain, while on a sidechain is created by the mainchain registration command.

<img src="lip-0045/interoperability_store.png" width="80%">

_Figure 2: A summary of the Interoperability module store: Each box represents a substore, where we indicate the `storeKey --> storeValue` relation. The Interoperability module defines 7 substores on a sidechain: the outbox substore for outbox roots, the chain data substore for partner chain accounts and the own chain data substore for the own chain account, the channel data substore keeping track of the inbox and outbox, the validators data substore storing the partner-chain validators set, and the terminated state and terminated outbox substores to allow for recovery commands. The name and network ID stores, keeping track of the names and network IDs of registered sidechains, are present only on the mainchain._

### Message Forwarding and the Role of the Lisk Mainchain

In the Lisk ecosystem, the Lisk mainchain plays a central role, distinct from any other chain. It acts as an intermediary chain, [relaying cross-chain messages between sidechains][lip-0053]. This has a few notable advantages:

1. Relayers only need to follow the chosen sidechain and the mainchain. All CCMs sent to a given chain will go through the sidechain outbox on the mainchain.
2. The mainchain guarantees that messages are available and can be delivered to active sidechains. In the case in which the receiving sidechain is not active, the messages are returned to their sending chain. This allows the sidechain protocol to remain simple and agnostic to the state of other sidechains. In particular, transaction handling does not require knowledge of all potential receiving chains.

### Inbox and Outbox

As explained above, inbox and outbox are organized as regular Merkle trees. Since the root of the tree depends on the order of insertion, all cross-chain messages have to be inserted in the receiving chain in the same order in which they were included in the sending chain, guaranteeing that they are processed in the correct order.

Using a Merkle tree also guarantees that the number of sibling hashes that are part of inclusion proofs grows only logarithmically with the number of elements in the tree. In particular, this means that the number of sibling hashes required to validate the cross-chain messages in a CCU against the partner chain `lastCertificate.stateRoot` grows logarithmically with the number of processed messages.

#### Storage of the Outbox Root

The outbox root property is duplicated and additionally stored separately from all other properties of the chain account. The store prefix of the outbox root is the constant `STORE_PREFIX_OUTBOX_ROOT` and the store key is the hash of the chain ID of the partner chain. Storing the outbox root with a different store prefix allows to separate the subtree corresponding to the outbox roots from the rest of the data in the interoperability store. This choice allows for shorter inclusion proofs for the outbox root, as the other properties of the Interoperability module are not needed to recalculate the state root if the outbox root is known. In particular, the inclusion proof contained in a CCU from a sidechain posted on the mainchain will contain only one hash.

### Storage of Auxiliary Data

In order to process sidechain registration commands more efficiently, it is convenient to store on the mainchain auxiliary data that can be used to check the uniqueness of the sidechain name and network ID. For instance, if an entry is already present in the name auxiliary data, it means that a chain with that name is already registered in the ecosystem.  

## Specification

#### uint32be Function

The function `uint32be(x)` returns the big endian uint32 serialization of an integer `x`, with `0 <= x < 2^32`. This serialization is always 4 bytes long.

### Interoperability Module Store

The key-value pairs in the module store are organized in the following substores.

#### Outbox Root Substore

The outbox root substore holds the root of the outbox of each partner chain.

##### Store Prefix, Store Key, and Store Value

* The store prefix is set to `STORE_PREFIX_OUTBOX_ROOT`.
* Each store key is set to `uint32be(chainID)`, where `chainID` is the ID of the partner chain.
* Each store value is the serialization of an object following the JSON schema `outboxRootSchema` presented below.
* Notation: For the rest of this proposal let `outboxRoot(chainID)` be the outbox root identified by the store key `chainID`.

##### JSON Schema

```java
outboxRootSchema = {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["root"],

        }
    }
}
```

##### Properties and Default values

* `root`: The root of the underlying Merkle tree of the partner chain outbox. This value is initialized to `EMPTY_HASH`.

#### Chain Data Substore

The chain data substore holds information about other partner chains.

##### Store Prefix, Store Key, and Store Value

    }
}
```

##### Properties and Default values

In this section, we describe the properties of a chain account and specify their default values.

* `name`: This property corresponds to the name of the sidechain as a string of characters. It has to be unique in the ecosystem. For the mainchain account on a sidechain, this property is initialized to the string `MAINCHAIN_NAME`. For a sidechain account on the mainchain, this property is set by the sidechain registration command.
* `networkID`: This property corresponds to the network identifier, or network ID, of the partner chain. For a sidechain account on the mainchain, it is set by the [sidechain registration command][lip-0043]. For the mainchain account on sidechains, it is a protocol constant, set to `MAINCHAIN_NETWORK_ID`.
* `lastCertificate`: This property holds some information from the certificate posted contained in the last CCU from the partner chain. It is an object containing the following properties:
    * `height`: The height contained in the last certificate from the partner chain. It is used to [validate a certificate][lip-0053] (certificates must contain block headers with increasing heights). The default value of this property is 0.
    * `timestamp`: The timestamp contained in the last certificate from the partner chain. On the mainchain, it is used to check that the sidechain chain fulfills the liveness requirement (see [above](#Liveness-Condition)). The default value of this property is 0.
    * `stateRoot`: The state root contained in the last certificate from the partner chain. It is used to validate the inclusion proof of the cross-chain messages contained in a CCU and to verify the validity of the token recovery command. The default value of this property is the constant `EMPTY_HASH`.

As explained [above](#Life-Cycle-of-a-Sidechain), there are 3 possible statuses: ''active'', ''registered'', and ''terminated''. The default value of this property is `CHAIN_REGISTERED`, corresponding to the "registered" status.

#### Channel Data Substore

The channel data substore holds information about the inbox and outbox with other partner chains.

This function is only called on the mainchain when processing a CCU. It is specified in [LIP 0049][lip-0049].

#### sendInternal

The `sendInternal` function is used to create and add a message to the outbox of a partner chain.

##### Parameters

This function has the following input parameters in the order given below:

* `feeAddress`: The address of the account paying the fee.
* `moduleID`: The ID of the module calling this function.
* `crossChainCommandID`: The ID of the command calling this function.
* `receivingChainID`: The ID of the receiving chain.
* `fee`: The message fee.
* `status`: The message status.
* `params`: The message parameters.

##### Returns

Nothing.

##### Execution

```python
sendInternal(feeAddress, moduleID, crossChainCommandID, receivingChainID, fee, status, params):
    # Processing on the mainchain
    if ownChainAccount.ID == MAINCHAIN_ID:
        # Chain has to exist on mainchain
        if chainAccount(receivingChainID) does not exists:
            raise MissingChainError

### Genesis Block Processing

#### Genesis State Initialization

During the genesis state initialization stage, the following steps are executed. If any step fails, the block is discarded and has no further effect.

Let `genesisBlockAssetBytes` be the `data` bytes included in the block assets for the Interoperability module and let `interoperabilityAsset` be the deserialization of `genesisBlockAssetBytes` according to the `genesisInteroperabilityStoreSchema` schema, given below. Each top level entry in the schema corresponds to the substore of the Interoperability module store with the same name.

* Within each substore, check that all entries have a different `storeKey`.
* For each entry in the chain data substore there must be a corresponding entry (with the same value of `storeKey`) in the outbox root, channel data, and chain validators substores and viceversa. However, if the chain account has status set to terminated, the entry in the outbox root must *not* be present.
* For each entry in the terminated outbox substore there must be a corresponding entry (with the same value of `storeKey`) in the terminated state substore.
* For each entry in the terminated state substore, if the property `initialized` is set to `false`, the corresponding entry in the terminated outbox substore must *not* be present. Furthermore, the `stateRoot` must be set to empty bytes and `mainchainStateRoot` to a 32-bytes value. Conversely, if the property `initialized` is set to `true`, the `stateRoot` must be set to a 32-bytes value and `mainchainStateRoot` to empty bytes.
* For each entry `chainValidators` in `interoperabilityAsset.chainValidatorsSubstore`, let `activeValidators = chainValidators.storeValue.activeValidators` and let `certificateThreshold = chainValidators.storeValue.certificateThreshold`:
  * `activeValidators` must have at least 1 element and at most `MAX_NUM_VALIDATORS` elements.
  * `activeValidators` must be ordered lexicographically by `blsKey` property.
  * All `blsKey` properties have length 48 and are pairwise distinct.  
  * The `bftWeight` property of each element is a positive integer.
  * Let `totalWeight` be the sum of the `bftWeight` property of every element in `activeValidators`. Then `totalWeight` has to be less than or equal to `MAX_UINT64`.
  * Check that `⌊ ⅓ x totalWeight⌋ + 1 <= certificateThreshold <= totalWeight`, where `⌊⋅⌋` is the floor function.
* If a chain account for another sidechain is present, than a chain account for the mainchain (`chainID = 1`) must be present, as well as the own chain account.
* For each entry `channelData` in `interoperabilityAsset.channelDataSubstore`, let `channel = channelData.storeValue`:
  * Either `channel.messageFeeTokenID={chainID=1, localID=0}` (corresponding to the LSK token), or `channel.messageFeeTokenID.chainID` must be equal to `channelData.storeKey` or `ownChainAccount.ID` (the message fee token must be a native token of either chains).
* For every substore, create all the corresponding entries in the Interoperability module state.

#### Genesis State Finalization

The Interoperability module does not execute any logic during the genesis state finalization.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal, together with [LIP 0043][lip-0043], [LIP 0049][lip-0049], [LIP 0053][lip-0053], and [LIP 0054][lip-0054], is part of the Interoperability module. Chains adding this module will need to do so with a hard fork.
